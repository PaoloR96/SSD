# 🛍️ E-Commerce Development  

The application has been developed following a **microservices architecture**,  
with each service running inside **Docker containers** and orchestrated using **Docker Compose**.  

External requests are managed through an **Nginx reverse proxy**,  
which routes the traffic to the internal services.  

The entire solution has been **deployed on a DigitalOcean virtual machine**,  
serving as the **cloud infrastructure (IaaS)**.  

Additionally, to assess the cloud security posture,  
the **CSA CCM v4 framework** is applied in combination with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.
